<div>My exercise program</div>
<div>The purpose of this program is to give a vegetarian user a workout routine and meal plan depending on their goals and experience.</div>
## Features
- Let user set preferences
- Alert user when it is a meal time or a workout time
- Show the user what to eat or which exercises to do
- Allow user to choose their own menu items to meet the dietary quota set by the program
- Display dynamic running totals of key nutrition facts ie. Calories, Fat, Protein and Carbs.
